The "Stone Paper Scissors" game project is an engaging and educational venture that aims to digitize the classic hand game known worldwide. This project involves designing and developing a software application where players can compete against each other or an AI opponent in the traditional game of rock-paper-scissors. The primary objectives include enhancing programming skills, understanding game logic, and creating an intuitive user interface. By implementing features such as score tracking, dynamic animations, and difficulty levels, this project not only provides a fun gaming experience but also serves as a practical example of applying coding principles in a real-world scenario.
